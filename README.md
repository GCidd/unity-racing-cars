# Racing Cars Game - Unity3D

This project was developed in the context of the course called "Development of Mobile Applications and Games", in the Master of Philosophy Postgraduate studies program - "Advanced Technologies in Informatics and Computers" at the International Hellenic University.
The project was proposed by me, as the available one was not considered challenging enough by me. This was the first project I made when I started learning Unity 3D.

# Description
This is a third person 3D game.

In the initial scene, the player appears in an open space where there are other "players" that move randomly. If the player touches someone else, they both appear in another scene and participate in a car race. If at the time he touched the other player there are others close, they will also run towards the player and participate in the race as well.

If the player wins the race, he receives 5 gold for each opponent he won and they will disappear from the map. If he loses the race, he will lose 1 gold for each opponent in the match. With the gold he earns, the player can paint their car through the shop (available by pressing the ESC button during the first scene) and increase the car's acceleration and maximum speed.

If the player touches an opponent without them realizing it (without turning red), the player receives a positive boost (increased max. speed and acceleration) at the start of the race and the opponent will receive a negative boost (reduced speed and acceleration). If the opponent touches the player first, they receive a negative boost and the opponent a positive boost.

The whole project was done by using assets and scripts provided by the Unity Standard Assets package.
